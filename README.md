# Data-repository

Welcome to my Data-repository!

As a representation of all the data used in my paper, I have uploaded the operating state data of the tire coupling under four conditions: one bolt loose, two diagonal bolts loose, two adjacent bolts loose and uniformly tight.

Corresponding Relations:
- one bolt loose (One bolt loose.txt)
- two diagonal bolts loose (Two diagonal bolts loose.txt)
- two adjacent bolts loose (Two adjacent bolts loose.txt)
- uniformly tight (Uniformly tight.txt)
...

The data was uploaded in .txt format, and in the file for each operating state, the first column contains time data and the second column contains acceleration data. Because the amount of data used for the experiment is too large, I only intercepted 200000 rows of data starting from the 120,0001th row for each running state to upload. These 200000 rows of data can constitute 100 experimental samples.
